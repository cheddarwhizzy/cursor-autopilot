# Project Tasks

## Project Overview
Building a modern web application with React, TypeScript, and Node.js backend. The application will be a task management system with user authentication, real-time updates, and a clean, responsive UI.

## Current Sprint

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Initialize project structure
  - [ ] Create frontend directory with React + TypeScript
  - [ ] Create backend directory with Node.js + Express
  - [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration for both frontend and backend
  - [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier
  - [ ] Set up Git repository with proper .gitignore

### 2. Backend Development
- [ ] Set up Express server
  - [ ] Configure basic Express app with TypeScript
  - [ ] Set up middleware (cors, body-parser, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement error handling middleware
  - [ ] Set up logging system

- [ ] Database Setup
  - [ ] Set up PostgreSQL database
  - [ ] Create database schema
  - [ ] Implement database migrations
  - [ ] Set up connection pooling

- [ ] Authentication System
  - [ ] Implement JWT authentication
  - [ ] Create user registration endpoint
  - [ ] Create login endpoint
  - [ ] Implement password hashing
  - [ ] Add refresh token mechanism

### 3. Frontend Development
- [ ] Set up React application
  - [ ] Configure Vite with TypeScript
  - [ ] Set up routing with React Router
  - [ ] Implement state management with Redux Toolkit
  - [ ] Set up API client with Axios

- [ ] UI Components
  - [ ] Create reusable UI components
  - [ ] Implement responsive layout
  - [ ] Add loading states and error boundaries
  - [ ] Set up theme system

### 4. Core Features
- [ ] Task Management
  - [ ] Create task model and API endpoints
  - [ ] Implement task CRUD operations
  - [ ] Add task filtering and sorting
  - [ ] Implement task status updates

- [ ] User Interface
  - [ ] Create dashboard layout
  - [ ] Implement task list view
  - [ ] Add task creation form
  - [ ] Create task detail view

### 5. Testing
- [ ] Backend Testing
  - [ ] Set up Jest for backend tests
  - [ ] Write API endpoint tests
  - [ ] Implement database tests
  - [ ] Add authentication tests

- [ ] Frontend Testing
  - [ ] Set up React Testing Library
  - [ ] Write component tests
  - [ ] Implement integration tests
  - [ ] Add end-to-end tests with Cypress

### 6. Deployment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions
  - [ ] Set up automated testing
  - [ ] Configure deployment to staging
  - [ ] Set up production deployment

- [ ] Infrastructure
  - [ ] Set up Docker containers
  - [ ] Configure Nginx
  - [ ] Set up SSL certificates
  - [ ] Configure monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- All features must be fully tested
- Code coverage must be above 80%
- Application must be responsive on all devices
- All API endpoints must be documented
- Security best practices must be followed
- Performance must be optimized
- Error handling must be comprehensive

## Blockers/Questions
- Need to decide on specific UI component library
- Need to determine database backup strategy
- Need to finalize authentication requirements
- Need to decide on monitoring solution
