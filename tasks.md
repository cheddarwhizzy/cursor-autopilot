  - [ ] Configure deployment to staging
  - [ ] Set up production deployment

- [ ] Infrastructure
  - [ ] Set up Docker containers
  - [ ] Configure Nginx
  - [ ] Set up SSL certificates
  - [ ] Configure monitoring

## New Feature Requirements: Configurable Automation & API Integration

### 1. YAML-Based Configuration
- [ ] Migrate all configuration to a single YAML file (replacing/merging any existing config.json)
- [ ] Support configuration of keystrokes, delays, and automation options via YAML
- [ ] Allow separate, customizable keystroke sets for Cursor and Windsurf platforms
- [ ] Add support for Windows and Ubuntu Desktop platforms (if programmatic keystroke sending is possible)
- [ ] Implement platform-specific initialization keystrokes in YAML config
- [ ] Example YAML structure:

```yaml
platforms:
  cursor:
    os_type: osx  # or 'windows' or 'linux'
    initialization:
      - keys: "command+shift+p"
        delay_ms: 100
    keystrokes:
      - keys: "command+l"
        delay_ms: 100
    options:
      enable_auto_mode: true
      continuation_prompt: "Continue?"
      initial_prompt: "Start session"
      timeout_seconds: 30
  windsurf:
    os_type: osx  # or 'windows' or 'linux'
    initialization:
      - keys: "command+shift+p"
        delay_ms: 100
    keystrokes:
      - keys: "command+l"
        delay_ms: 100
    options:
      enable_auto_mode: false
      continuation_prompt: "Continue?"
      initial_prompt: "Start session"
      timeout_seconds: 30
```

# To support Windows or Linux, set `os_type: windows` or `os_type: linux` under the relevant platform (cursor/windsurf) and use the appropriate key syntax for that OS.

### 2. API Endpoints (for Slack Integration)
- [ ] Implement POST endpoints to:
  - Enable/disable auto mode (toggle automatic keystroke sending)
  - Grab a screenshot of the IDE platform
  - Set the timeout for sending the continuation prompt
  - Set the continuation or initial prompt
- [ ] Endpoints should be Slack-app compatible (JSON responses, Slack-friendly error handling)

### 3. OpenAI Vision Integration
- [ ] From YAML config, define conditions to trigger OpenAI Vision (e.g., file type, user action)
- [ ] If condition is true, take a screenshot and ask a question; then run a set of keystrokes based on the result
- [ ] If condition is false, run an alternate set of keystrokes
- [ ] Ensure this workflow is compatible with Slack commands and API triggers

### 4. Migration
- [ ] Remove and merge all config.json settings into the new YAML config
- [ ] Document all YAML options and provide migration instructions

### 5. Update run.sh for Config Flags
- [ ] Add support to run.sh for accepting command-line flags to override config parameters, including:
  - `--project_path`
  - `--platform`
  - `--debug`
  - `--inactivity_delay`
  - `--send_message`
  - (and any other relevant config options)
- [ ] Ensure CLI flags take precedence over YAML config values
- [ ] Document usage examples in the README

## Acceptance Criteria
- All features must be fully tested
- Code coverage must be above 80%
- Application must be responsive on all devices
- All API endpoints must be documented
- Security best practices must be followed
- Performance must be optimized
- Error handling must be comprehensive

## Blockers/Questions
- Need to decide on specific UI component library
- Need to determine database backup strategy
- Need to finalize authentication requirements
- Need to decide on monitoring solution
