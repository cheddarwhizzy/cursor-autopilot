# Setup Guide

## TL;DR

1. **Edit your configuration:**
   - Open `config.json` in the project root and adjust it to fit your project/environment.
2. **Run the main script:**
   - Execute `./run.sh` to start everything. This will:
     - Open your project in Cursor
     - Generate `initial_prompt.txt` from your config
     - Ensure the chat window is open
     - Start both the Slack bot and watcher with unified logs

That's it! For most users, these are the only steps needed.
