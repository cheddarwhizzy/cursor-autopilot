## ðŸš€ Installation Examples

### Basic Installation
```bash
# One-liner installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheddarwhizzy/cursor-autopilot/main/cursor-agent-iteration/install-curl.sh | bash

# Initialize the system
cursor-iter iterate-init

# Start iterating
cursor-iter iterate
```

# Install with specific model
cursor-iter iterate-init --model gpt-4o

# Run iterations with specific model
MODEL="gpt-4o" cursor-iter iterate
```

## ðŸ“‹ Task Management Examples

### Adding New Tasks

**Add Authentication Tasks:**
```bash
cursor-iter add-feature --prompt "Add comprehensive authentication tasks: OAuth2 integration, JWT token management, user session handling, and security tests. Include acceptance criteria for OAuth2 providers (Google, GitHub), JWT validation, session storage, and security scanning."
```

**Add API Development Tasks:**
```bash
cursor-iter add-feature --prompt "Add GraphQL API tasks: schema design, resolvers implementation, authentication middleware, rate limiting, and comprehensive testing. Include tasks for query optimization, error handling, and API documentation generation."
```

**Add Database Tasks:**
```bash
cursor-iter add-feature --prompt "Add database optimization tasks: query performance analysis, indexing strategy, connection pooling, migration scripts, and backup procedures. Include acceptance criteria for query execution time, connection limits, and data integrity."
```

### Refining Existing Tasks

**Update Task Priority:**
```bash
cursor-iter add-feature --prompt "Reorder tasks.md to prioritize security-related tasks first, then performance optimization, then feature development. Add context about why security is the highest priority."
```

**Add More Detail to Tasks:**
```bash
cursor-iter add-feature --prompt "Update the 'Add logging' task to include structured logging with correlation IDs, log aggregation setup, and monitoring integration. Add acceptance criteria for log format consistency and searchability."
```

**Merge Similar Tasks:**
```bash
cursor-iter add-feature --prompt "Combine the 'Add logging' and 'Add monitoring' tasks into a single 'Observability implementation' task with comprehensive acceptance criteria for both logging and monitoring."
```
