make iterate
```

## ðŸ“‹ Essential Commands

| Command | What it does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `make iterate-init` | Sets up the iteration system | `make iterate-init` |
| `make iterate` | Runs the next task | `make iterate` |

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Use Cases

### Daily Development
```bash
# Start your day with
make iterate

# Add tasks as they come up
make tasks-update PROMPT="Add task for fixing the login bug"
```

### Feature Development
```bash
# Add comprehensive feature tasks
make tasks-update PROMPT="Add tasks for implementing user dashboard: API endpoints, frontend components, authentication, and testing"

# Work on the feature
make iterate
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Focus on quality improvements
